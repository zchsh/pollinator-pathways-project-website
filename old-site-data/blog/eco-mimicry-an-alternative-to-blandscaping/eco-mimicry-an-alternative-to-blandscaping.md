Blandscaping is all around us from manicured urban landscapes of exotic greenery to single-crop agricultural landscapes. Despite the green appearance of blandscapes, local biodiversity suffers

because the usual pieces of a well-adapted ecological system, rich in relationships, are no longer present. For example, when we neglect to plant native flowers, we also exclude the native pollinators that have evolved in tandem with the plants. The antidote to blandscaping is eco-mimicry where we allow nature to be our guide in designing not only aesthetically pleasing landscapes but those that offer a myriad of ecological relationships. Read more about blandscaping and why not all green space is created equal in this fascinating article byStuart Connop and Caroline Nash published by FastCompany!
