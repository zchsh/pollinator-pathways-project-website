With the holidays fast-approaching, we have compiled a collection of holiday dishes you can make using in-season, Ontario produce. Eating local and in-season has an assortment of health, economic and environmental benefits. First of all, local, in-season produce does not need to travel, therefore the foods retain more nutrients and less carbon emissions are released. As well, since the produce is picked to be sold immediately, it is much more flavourful than the produce that is picked to be stored and shipped. Also, the food is not required to stay fresh in transit, therefore the produce does not require the same heavy preservatives as foods being shipped. Buying local also helps to strengthen the local economy by supporting local farmers and keeping the money in your community.

  

Although there is far less produce in-season in the winter, some local fruits and veggies include: onions, parsnips, squash, sweet potatoes, turnips, carrots, potatoes, cabbage, apples and pears. We hope some of the following recipes will inspire you to eat some local, in-season produce this season!
