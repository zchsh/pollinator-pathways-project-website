						<h2>Phase 2 now underway!</h2>
						<p>Pollinator Gardens for Central London</p>
						<p>
							In 2023, Pollinator Pathways Project will begin an initiative to
							install free pollinator gardens for homes, businesses, and
							institutions along the Central London Pathway, expanding on our
							2022 Dundas Street Pathway project. This project is being made
							possible by a donation from Lush Cosmetics.
						</p>
						<p>
							The 13 Central London (Ontario) communities in the Dundas Street
							Corridor that we are targeting are: Blackfriars, Carling Heights,
							Downtown, Hamilton Road, Kensington Village, Midtown, North
							Talbot, OEV, Piccadilly, Riverforks, SoHo, The Smokestack
							District, and Woodfield.

							Have you seen small wooden planters in front of businesses and
							services along Dundas St? These planters are part of the Dundas
							Pollinator Pathway!
						</p>
						<p>
							We distributed these planters in May of 2022 with diverse
							combinations of geranium, evening primrose, coreopsis, columbine,
							beardtongue, and monarda. Individual businesses and services may
							have decided to change up the planter contents, adding new plants
							as well. So get outside and discover our planters.

						<h2>Our Vision For Central London</h2>
						<p>
							Our project started on Dundas Street and has since spread to
							include 13 communities in Central London! In Phase 1, we
							collaborated with businesses, schools, and other organizations
							along Dundas Street to install permanent native plant gardens and
							planters on their property. By adding pollinator-friendly
							vegetation to London's downtown core, we are building a corridor
							for these species to navigate the most densely urbanized area of
							the city. Our downtown focus for this project also helps us reach
							a large audience to raise awareness of the importance of
							pollinators.
						</p>
						<p>
							To date, we have planted permanent gardens located at Museum
							London, the Western Fair, Covent Garden Market, and the London
							Central Library. We have also distributed 40 small pollinator
							planters to our partnering businesses and services. We are
							currently aiming to create additional permanent gardens at H.B.
							Beal Secondary School, Catholic Central High School, and St.
							Leonardâ€™s Community Services.
