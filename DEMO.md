# Website demo


## Introduction

- Previously using Wix
- Purpose of this demo is to provide another option, might not be the right option
- Usually, look & feel of the website aren't the most critical thing to get right... it's about communication
- And to communicate, we need communicators. Which is folks who manage the content on the website.
- If it's the case that P3 can imagine having a website that looks the same for a long time, but the content changes...
- Then one thing to focus on might be the authoring experience...

- Other tools exist, like Wix, or Squarespace, or countless others
- Feels worth talking about the tradeoffs
- Flexbility vs focus
- Many web builder tools promise flexbility. Has its benefits. Also has its downsides.
- Approach this proposed website takes is focus. We want folks contributing blog posts etc to be focused on the content.
- There are website builders out there that focus on content as well. But then things like Zeffy integration, email newsletter, and contact form can become a little more difficult to do exaclty the way you might want to.

## How the proposed website works

- Technical details are hard. Easier to walk through the content editing process.
- TODO - add admin link in footer. Could be page-specific, probably?
- Go to admin panel. Choose the content you want to edit.
