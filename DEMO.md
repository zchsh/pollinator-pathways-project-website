# Website demo

## Introduction

- Previously using Wix
- Flexbility vs focus
- Many web builder tools promise flexbility. Has its benefits. Also has its downsides
- Approach this proposed website takes is focus. We want folks contributing blog posts etc to be focused on the content.

## How the proposed website works

- Technical details are hard. Easier to walk through the content editing process.
- TODO - add admin link in footer. Could be page-specific, probably?
- Go to admin panel. Choose the content you want to edit.
