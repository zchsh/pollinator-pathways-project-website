# Website demo

## Introduction

- Hi, I'm Zach
- Talking about the website today
- Specifically, looking at other ways to build and manage the website

- Currently the website is managed on Wix
- Why look for other options? My understanding...
- Expensive. Site builders can be expensive.
- Difficult to use. As someone who writes website code for a living, I actually find a lot of website builders hard to use.
- Guessing, but root cause is that platforms like Wix are trying to work for EVERYONE. So there can be an overwhelming number of little things you can change
- In some cases, this can end up distracting from what you might actually want to focus on.
- Usually, look & feel of the website aren't the most critical thing to get right... it's about communication
- And to communicate, we need communicators. Which is folks who manage the content on the website.
- If it's the case that P3 can imagine having a website that looks the same for a long time, but the content changes...
- Then one thing to focus on might be the authoring experience...

- The purpose of this demo is to give you demo of another option
- I want to emphasize that this might not be the right option...
- So as some background, we can think of a website as having both structure, and content. The structure means the kinds of pages that exist, and how they're organized, for example in the navigation. The content means the words and images that are shown on those pages.
- The option that I'm showing today does NOT give you easy control over the structure of the website. This is the big tradeoff.
- The option I'm showing aims to focus on making it easy to change your content.
- A demo's probably the easiest way...

- Here's the home page. It's mostly the same as the old home page
- At the very bottom of the page, there's an `Edit` link. Let's click that.
- This'll take a few minutes to take effect. The preview is instant, but the deployment isn't. This is part of what keeps the site free.

- Again, one big downside of this tool is that it does require code knowledge to change the structure. I've written the code in a very common language, so in theory you can find volunteers who can help with this if I'm busy... but I know it's rarely that easy.
- I can definitely make the time to support y'all in adding and managing content. But I won't necessarily have the time to be able to work on the structure all that much.

- Other tools exist, like Wix, or Squarespace, or countless others, that'll give you more control over structure
- Many web builder tools promise flexbility. Has its benefits. Also has its downsides.
- Approach this proposed website takes is focus. We want folks contributing blog posts etc to be focused on the content.
- There are website builders out there that focus on content as well. But then things like Zeffy integration, email newsletter, and contact form can become a little more difficult to do exaclty the way you might want to.

## Next steps

- Open source the site. Share it ASAP in case anything happens or changes.
- Content editing instructions. Writing things up makes sense.
- Newsletter form. How do y'all currently manage this?
    - We can take this out for now. Drop it! Easy.
- Contact form. We can send an automatic reponse, it'll just look a little simpler.
    - Contact form is definitely important
- RSS - sounds good with folks, probably just the blog would make sense for now
- Donate button, Education section - in the navigation would be nice
    - April will work on this
    - Nav might be worth surfacing as an editable area
- Current Projects / Resource Kits - kind of like "Kits" / get involved
- Volunteer information page - have signup form, but no info page. Need info page.
- Blog posts are relatively high effort... sharing articles on some app (Carbon?)
