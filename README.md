## Local development

First, make sure you have [Node](https://nodejs.org/en) installed, version 18 or later. You'll need some experience with [command line interfaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface) as well. Once Node is installed, [`cd`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cd_(command)) into this project folder, and run [`npm i` to install dependencies](https://nodejs.org/en/learn/getting-started/an-introduction-to-the-npm-package-manager).

Once you have Node installed and have installed `package.json` dependencies with `npm i`, you can run the development command:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```
