Thanks to a donation by Lush Cosmetics, Pollinator Pathways Project is launching a project to design and install free pollinator gardens for residences, businesses, and institutions in the Central London Pathway in 2023, building upon our 2022 Dundas Street Pathway project.

**There will be three types of pollinator gardens available**:

1. Large In-ground Pollinator Gardens – these will be gardens up to 500 square feet populated with native plants selected in conjunction with the participant from a list provided by Pollinator Pathways Project Garden Designer![](</uploads/Blog Posts/in-ground-garden.jpeg>)
2. Raised Pollinator Garden Beds – these will be constructed of treated 2x4 lumber. There will be 3 shapes to choose from; Rectangle, Pentagon, and Hexagon. The Raised Pollinator Garden Beds can be combined in multiple ways to create unique designs and sizes to suit the target location, in conjunction with the participant and the Pollinator Pathways Project Garden Designer![](</uploads/Blog Posts/raised-pollinator-garden-beds.jpeg>)
3. Pollinator-in-a-Box Planters – the planters are made from pressure treated lumber to ensure they will stand up to our environment, filled with topsoil, and include annual plants that are known to attract pollinators. Planter size and annual plant type will be agreed in conjunction with the participant from a list provided by Pollinator Pathways Project Garden Designer![](</uploads/Blog Posts/pollinator-in-a-box-planters.jpeg>)

**How to Request a Free Pollinator Garden**:

1. Go to the [Pollinator Garden Request Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdfHI8aGNYKdiSriBi5NKDB_cL70OPplySlThyBrg7Ylmdz2g/viewform?usp=sf_link)
2. Complete the information requested
3. Click on Submit
4. P3 will contact you to arrange a time to discuss the design of your garden with the P3 Garden Designer

The 13 Central London communities in the Central London Pathway that we are targeting are:

* Blackfriars
* Carling Heights
* Downtown
* Hamilton Road
* Kensington Village
* Midtown
* North Talbot
* Old East Village
* Piccadilly
* Riverforks
* SoHo
* The Smokestack District

Bees, butterflies, and pollination go hand-in-hand. Providing shelter, along with a floral buffet, is the best way to ensure these friendly guests visit your garden season after season. Pollinators prefer native flowering plants that have adapted alongside them over the generations. Locally adapted native plants attract solitary bees, butterflies, and other pollinators.

**Pollinators in Trouble**:

Pollinators are a critical part of our ecosystems; without them, we don’t eat—it’s as simple as that. At the moment, large numbers of pollinators are dying around the world. With the world’s human population projected to exceed 9 billion in just the next 30 years or so, protecting pollinators is crucial. Flowering plants and vegetables require pollination, and various animals, including bees and butterflies, are a critical part of the pollinator-plant ecosystem.

One major reason for global pollinator population decline is habitat loss. Pollinators require natural spaces with vegetation and flowering plants in which to live and forage for their food: pollen and nectar. Most experts agree that concrete, asphalt, and metal surfaces, so common in our urban and suburban communities, replace vegetated areas, limit habitat for ground-nesting pollinators and provide scarce opportunities for pollinator foraging.

**Pollinator Pathways Project (P3)** is a grass-roots group of environmental volunteers dedicated to promoting London as a pollinator sanctuary through providing our communities with the resources to achieve this goal. P3 got started in 2019 when a handful of individuals, concerned about the plight of pollinators in London, got together to plant a community pollinator garden. This successful event provided them with the impetus to launch P3. It was swiftly identified that through creating attractive environments for pollinators in an urban setting, a variety of essential habitats for insects and birds could be provided. With our volunteers participating at environmental events such as Seedy Saturday and the Spring Plant Sale, P3 is becoming recognized as the group to reach out to when it comes to anything involving pollinators.
