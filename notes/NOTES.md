# Notes

## Next steps

### Revisit priorities with simplified approach

- Zeffy - should probably stay
- Contact form - can be dropped in favour of `mailto:` link (though form is probably a good idea, definitely reduces friction eg for volunteer communication)
- Mailing list - can be dropped in favour of blind-CC emails. Later, use Zeffy, it's free.
- Home page - keep as-is for now, could revisit later

- [ ] Revisit Figma with super-simplified approach

### Contact form

- [ ] Simple version... `mailto:` link!
  - `mailto:user@example.com?subject=&:subjectbody=:body`
  - Implement this, maybe have a CMS option to `Use contact form` / `Use email link` in the contact form configuration?

- [ ] Investigate how contact form will work
  - Form submission needs to go somewhere... use MailGun I guess?
  - Looking up `Contact form to email` services seems like a good direction. Examples... <https://web3forms.com>, <https://www.formspark.io>, <https://www.smtp2go.com/pricing/>
  - [Nodemailer](https://nodemailer.com/) might be a useful thing to look at

### Drop blog from website display

- [ ] Drop `blog` from navigation

### Test TinaCMS

- Had a multi-deployment setup at some point... will probably make sense to do that again?

### Mailing list

- [ ] Investigate what mailing list tool P3 London is using
  - I think probably Wix? So we need to migrate their mailing list out of Wix... and into some new tool.

Notes from a couple years ago...

- [ ] Set up email platform
    - See if you can do the "welcome email" thing?
    - https://convertkit.com/ seems popular
    - https://buttondown.email/ looks promising, maybe best? Do they expect a lot of subscribers? Maybe start with $ 9 / mo plan?
    - https://www.mailerlite.com also looks neat, seems like best option so far
    - Zeffy also seems to have some email features... see "Donor Management" stuff: https://www.zeffy.com/home/donor-management

### Remaining pages

- [ ] Get a rough implementation of all pages done
  - Goal is to have content on the page. Doesn't need to be editable. Doesn't need to look good. That can come later.
  - Already mostly done this, kind of "tracking" it in Figma

- [ ] Get a polished design done for each page
  - Stay in Figma for now. You'll have wireframed everything out, screengrab the wireframes and reference them.
  - Current goal is parity with the existing website. Can probably avoid review cycles by sticking to that.

- [ ] Plan out design and development tasks for remaining pages
  - aka rough wire-framing, searching for potentially sharp edges
  - Component-by-component breakdown might be nice
  - Dropping placeholder components into the page might make sense as well. Could use this as a way to test the basic functionality... does it feel right? If so, then layer nicer design, then do final implementation. If not, iterate on the stubbed-in implementation till it feels right.

- [ ] Continue work on page implementation
  - Once first cut is shared, may as well get ahead of it. Start with what you feel most sure of.

#### Blog post changes needed

- [x] Model support for "cover image"
- [x] Model support for "author" (exists on current blog, even if unused)
  - For now, this can be text field I think... later could have author collection
- [x] Render "author"
- [x] Render "cover image"
- [x] Model support for "category"
- [x] Render "category" (link to category pages?)
- [x] Model support for "date"
- [x] Render "date"

### Blog post migration

Goal is to _download_ content, not to get the whole blog working.

Migration status: 3 / 33

#### Blog post download process

- Visit the original URL
- Drag and drop to download all images
- Copy contents, paste into Obsidian to convert to Markdown
- Place the markdown and images in a new folder in `blog-raw-data`

#### Blog post migration process

- [ ] Open existing old blog post to compare as you go
- [ ] For images, create new folder in `public/uploads/Blog Posts`, and move all images into the folder
- [ ] Fix all image links within the markdown, to point to the images in the newly created folder
- [ ] Add YAML front-matter to the markdown. Match the structure of an existing blog post
- [ ] Skim through the markdown content and fix any other issues
- [ ] Run the project locally in order to test the page's appearance. 
- [ ] Compare the locally running post to the existing old blog post, to double-check everything looks right

## Future

### Editable navigation

- [ ] Implement editable top nav on all pages

## Done

### General

- [x] Fix `/admin` redirect loop
- [x] Update `README.md`, with notes on deployment strategy
- [x] Add custom domain
  - I've purchased `pollinatorpathwaysproject.ca` on NameCheap
  - Going forward, could redirect `pollinatorpathwaysproject.com` to `.ca`
  - Alternately, if it's an option, could transfer `pollinatorpathwaysproject.com` to some custom P3 account that I could make in NameCheap. Would also transfer `pollinatorpathwaysproject.ca` to that account.
- [x] Ensure custom domain actually works
  - `pollinatorpathwaysproject.ca` should function as expected
- [x] Ensure non-editable build works as static pages, editable is editable
  - Can test this locally
  - Or, should be able to go to `pollinatorpathwaysproject.ca/admin`, and be redirected

### Connect page

- [x] Build out functional contact form
  - Using [Formik](https://formik.org/docs/overview), familiar and I know it works
  - Next step is to get a submission to val.town working, should send the contact form as an email to myself. Can later update this to be a pollinator pathways email... but that will come WAY later.

### Navigation editing

- [x] Test out wiring up the navigation to be editable
