# Notes

## Next steps

- [x] Fix `/admin` redirect loop
- [x] Update `README.md`, with notes on deployment strategy
- [x] Add custom domain
  - I've purchased `pollinatorpathwaysproject.ca` on NameCheap
  - Going forward, could redirect `pollinatorpathwaysproject.com` to `.ca`
  - Alternately, if it's an option, could transfer `pollinatorpathwaysproject.com` to some custom P3 account that I could make in NameCheap. Would also transfer `pollinatorpathwaysproject.ca` to that account.
- [x] Ensure custom domain actually works
  - `pollinatorpathwaysproject.ca` should function as expected
- [ ] Ensure non-editable build works as static pages, editable is editable
  - Can test this locally
  - Or, should be able to go to `pollinatorpathwaysproject.ca/admin`, and be redirected
- [ ] Continue work on page design, in Figma
  - Feels right to finish a first cut, and share that first cut, before implementing
- [ ] Continue work on page implementation
  - Once first cut is shared, may as well get ahead of it. Start with what you feel most sure of.

### Blog post changes needed

- [x] Model support for "cover image"
- [x] Model support for "author" (exists on current blog, even if unused)
  - For now, this can be text field I think... later could have author collection
- [x] Render "author"
- [x] Render "cover image"
- [x] Model support for "category"
- [x] Render "category" (link to category pages?)
- [x] Model support for "date"
- [x] Render "date"
