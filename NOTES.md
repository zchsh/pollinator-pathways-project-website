# Notes

## Next steps

- [ ] Migrate all pages to the `/edit` editing approach
  - [x] Home
  - [ ] Blog collection view
  - [ ] Blog individual view
  - [ ] Central London Pathway
  - [ ] Connect
  - [ ] Donate
  - [ ] FAQ
  - [ ] Photos
  - [ ] Pollinator Kits
  - [ ] Resources
  - [ ] Sitewide (already kind of an "edit" page?)
- [ ] Update `README.md`, will now have single deployment
- [ ] Take down "editable" deployment from Vercel
- [ ] Continue work on page design, in Figma
  - Feels right to finish a first cut, and share that first cut, before implementing
- [ ] Continue work on page implementation
  - Once first cut is shared, may as well get ahead of it. Start with what you feel most sure of.
- [ ] Add custom domain
  - I've purchased `pollinatorpathwaysproject.ca` on NameCheap
  - Going forward, could redirect `pollinatorpathwaysproject.com` to `.ca`
  - Alternately, if it's an option, could transfer `pollinatorpathwaysproject.com` to some custom P3 account that I could make in NameCheap. Would also transfer `pollinatorpathwaysproject.ca` to that account.
