Pollinator Pathways Project (P3) is a local civic initiative begun in London (2018) as a response to addressing the lack of supportive habitats for native pollinators in London’s urban areas. Our latest initiative to address this lack of habitats is the Pollinator-in-a-Box Kit project. Learn more about the four Pollinator-in-a-Box Kits, and how to order them, from the Pollinator-in-a-Box Kit flyer.

  

One of the roles of P3 is to prepare habitats for native pollinators so they can access nectar feeding stations (facilitated by the **Flower Planter** kits and **Vegetable Planter** kits), seasonal shelter areas for species regeneration (helped by the **Butterfly House** kits and **Bee Hotel** kits), and develop travel pathways for bringing pollinators through existing urban areas (which you can ensure by buying and installing one or more of the kits). The kits would make an environmentally friendly Christmas or Hanukkah gift.
