Do you want your garden to be buzzing with pollinators this spring? There are plenty of tricks to make your flowerbeds the local pollinator hangout. First is diversity. Between bees, butterflies, beetles, moths, hummingbirds, and more, the only way to appeal to all pollinators is by housing a wide range of plant species. This will attract all types of pollinators to your garden.

  

Second is planting native species. Native species are best as they have co-evolved with local pollinators. This ensures pollinators are able to enjoy your garden to its fullest. Third is mass planting. Mass planting refers to planting patches of species rather than individual plants intertwined with other individuals.

  

Mass planting it easier for pollinators to spot their favorite species. Between using these tricks and planting the following Southern-Ontario natives, both you and local pollinators will adore your garden this spring!
