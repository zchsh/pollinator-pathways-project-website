## Do you live in London and enjoying painting or drawing?

We have the perfect giveaway and fun summer contest for you! We're launching a fun giveaway with the London Environmental Network where we're asking people in the community to paint, draw, or chalk up images of pollinators or pollinator-friendly plant species. If a plant species, it must be a native species to Ontario. There are no limits on what you can create here or the size, the contest is meant to be open to all ages and a fun way to engage with the outdoors and spend some time being creative. We can't wait to see what you come up with in the next few weeks! **Please note, regardless if you are the winner or not, we plan to share some artwork on our social media throughout the contest.** (Us sharing your artwork does not mean you are going to be selected or have a higher possibility of winning the contest, we would just like to share your creativity!)

1. **WINNER SELECTION:**
    

Chances of winning depend on the number of Participants.

The winner will be picked by a team of volunteers from both Pollinator pathways project and London Environmental Network. The winning selection will be based on the following criteria: 1. **Creativity** (we understand that not everyone is an artist, we will be not looking for the most professional piece of work, but rather are open to seeing all skill levels from all ages)

2. **Originality** (how much did you think outside the box, is this a unique idea or way to express the artwork)

3. **Relevance to native species (**the artwork needs to be of native species, both flora and fauna)

4. **Colour palette** (the use of lots of colour is not exactly what we're looking for, more how your colours compliment each other)
